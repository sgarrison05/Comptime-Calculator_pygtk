# comptime_calculator_gtk_py
Comptime Calculator rewritten in pygtk

The program in its current state uses two files in a temp directory.  You must create it first in your home directory or modifiy the code
to use any directory you want.  I recommend creating a comptime directory in your home folder and adjust the code accordingly.

The code is raw, but it works on a debian edition.  I am still working on getting it to work on an Arch distro.
